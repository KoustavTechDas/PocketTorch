# LED Control Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple LED control circuit using basic electronic components. It includes an LED, a resistor, a battery, and a switch. The primary goal of this project was to design and create both the schematic and custom PCB layout.

## Components Used

- **LED**: A light-emitting diode that lights up when current flows through it.
- **Resistor**: Limits the current flowing through the LED to prevent damage.
- **Battery**: Provides the power for the circuit.
- **Switch**: Allows the user to turn the LED on and off.

## Design and Layout

In this project, you will learn how to:

1. **Design Schematics**: Create a circuit schematic to outline the connections between the components.
2. **Design Custom PCB Layout**: Develop a custom PCB layout for manufacturing the circuit board.

The design was created using KiCad, following the guidelines and methodologies outlined in the book *KiCad Like a Pro* by Peter Dalmaris. This book is a valuable resource for learning more about PCB design and KiCad software.

## Instructions

1. **Schematic Design**: Create the schematic diagram with the components and their connections.
2. **PCB Layout**: Design the PCB layout based on the schematic, ensuring proper placement and routing of traces.
3. **Manufacturing**: Generate the Gerber files and other necessary files for PCB manufacturing.
4. **Assembly**: Solder the components onto the PCB according to the design.

## Additional Resources

For a more in-depth understanding of PCB design and KiCad, refer to the book *KiCad Like a Pro* by Peter Dalmaris. It provides comprehensive guidance and tips for working with KiCad.
